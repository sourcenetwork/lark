//! Measure how much stack each lark code path actually consumes.
//!
//! This matters because an embedded stack is commonly 4 to 8 KiB in
//! total. A frame that is too fat there is a hard crash on a guard
//! page, not a slowdown, and the project has never had a number for
//! it. Anything above 4 KiB is reported as a FINDING.
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! Stack painting, with the frame gaps cancelled out:
//!
//! 1. Recurse to a known depth, writing a byte pattern into a buffer
//!    in every frame, and return. The region below the caller's frame
//!    is now painted, except for the per-frame overhead (return
//!    address, saved registers) that the recursion could not write.
//! 2. Snapshot that region. This records where the un-paintable gaps
//!    are, so the next step does not have to guess.
//! 3. Repaint identically, run the workload, snapshot again.
//! 4. The lowest address whose byte differs between the two snapshots
//!    is how deep the workload went. The gaps appear identically in
//!    both snapshots and cancel, which is what makes this exact
//!    rather than accurate to one paint chunk.
//!
//! A calibration pass measures a workload with a known 64 KiB frame
//! first. Its excess over 64 KiB is the harness overhead, and it is
//! printed rather than silently subtracted.
//!
//! # What the numbers are not
//!
//! They are host figures. Frame layout is target-specific, so a value
//! measured on x86_64 does not transfer to ARM or RISC-V. Re-run this
//! on the target before treating any of it as a budget. The workload
//! can also coincidentally write the pattern byte at its deepest
//! point, which would under-report by a few bytes.
//!
//! # Running it
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --release --example stack_depth -- /tmp/lark-stack
//! ```
//!
//! Release matters: an unoptimized build has far larger frames and
//! measures the debug profile, not the shipped one.
