"""Append one benchmark run to the published history.

The history is the point. A single rendered `index.html` per CI run
answers "is this run fast" and nothing else: the moment it is replaced
the comparison it supported is gone. Keeping every run document and
rendering from the whole set instead answers "when did this regress",
which is the question a performance gate actually has to answer.

Layout under the site root:

    index.html          the dashboard, self-contained, reads the JSON below
    runs/index.json     manifest, newest first
    runs/<commit>.json  one run document per CI run, verbatim

The manifest is regenerated from the directory on every publish rather
than appended to, so a run file that was removed cannot leave a dangling
row behind, and a run file that was added out of band is still picked up.
