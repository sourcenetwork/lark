//! Loom models for the arena memtable and the engine's read horizon.
//!
//! Loom replays each model under every thread interleaving the C11
//! memory model permits, so what it checks is *ordering*: which value an
//! `Acquire` load may legally return given the `Release` stores that
//! preceded it. That is exactly the shape of the memtable's publication
//! protocol (invariant S1 in `engine::skiplist`) and of the read
//! horizon (H1 to H3 in `engine::read_horizon`).
//!
//! # What loom here does and does not prove
//!
//! Loom sees the atomics that come from `engine::sync` and the locks
//! built on them, and nothing else. It therefore checks:
//!
//! - that a reader which observes a node observes the links that were
//!   published before it, so a concurrent insert can neither hide an
//!   already-published key nor expose a half-linked tower;
//! - that a value read out of a node always belongs to the key and
//!   sequence the reader matched on;
//! - that the read horizon never advertises a sequence whose memtable
//!   insert the reader cannot yet see;
//! - that the flush handoff leaves every key reachable at every instant;
//! - that a reader pinning one version walks a whole snapshot across a
//!   concurrent compaction, and that a flush and a compaction
//!   publishing at once cannot lose one another's edits.
//!
//! The version models in [`version`] are protocol models and say so:
//! the production `VersionSet` writes a manifest record and opens an
//! SSTable reader inside `apply`, and its locks come from `parking_lot`
//! rather than from `engine::sync`, so loom can neither run it nor see
//! its ordering. What they reproduce is the part loom can decide - the
//! `Arc<Version>` pin, the clone-mutate-store, and the lock scope around
//! it - with the table contents stood in for.
//!
//! It does **not** check the raw key and value bytes for a data race:
//! those are plain arena memory, not a `loom::cell::UnsafeCell`, and
//! loom's cooperative scheduler physically sequences the writes anyway.
//! Byte-level aliasing, provenance and use-after-free are miri's job,
//! and `tests/loom_memtable.rs` documents which invariant each tool
//! covers.
//!
//! # Model size
//!
//! Every model is two or three threads doing two or three operations.
//! Nothing about the structure is shrunk for the checker: the tower is
//! its production `MAX_HEIGHT` of 12, because loom's partial-order
//! reduction prunes the levels no thread ever writes to, and the search
//! is the same size at 3 levels as at 12. [`explore`] counts both the
//! interleavings loom ran and the ones that reached the state being
//! checked, and fails the model if either is implausibly small: a model
//! that explores one schedule, or whose conditional assertion never
//! fires, is worse than no model at all.
//!
//! # Calibration
//!
//! Every positive model is paired with one that deliberately gets the
//! ordering wrong - the two-step seek `seek_ge` replaced, a flush that
//! retires the frozen memtable before it installs the table, a relaxed
//! read horizon, a compaction that publishes its removals and its
//! addition as two versions, two version swaps with nothing serializing
//! them - and the pair is only meaningful if the wrong one fails. They
//! are run as `#[should_panic]` tests in `tests/loom_memtable.rs`.
//!
//! A calibration stops at the first schedule that trips its assertion,
//! so [`explore`]'s floors never execute for one: the panic unwinds past
//! them. [`Report`] prints on the way out regardless, so the number a
//! calibration reports is how many schedules loom searched before it
//! found the bug, not how large its search space is.
