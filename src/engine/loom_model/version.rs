//! Models of the version handoff: a flush and a compaction publishing
//! into the same version while a reader walks it.
//!
//! This is a protocol model, and deliberately so. The production
//! `engine::manifest::VersionSet` writes a manifest record and
//! opens an `engine::sstable::SsTableReader` inside `apply`, and
//! its locks come from `std::sync` rather than from
//! `crate::sync`, so loom can neither run it nor see its
//! ordering. What is reproduced here is the part loom can decide:
//!
//! - `current()` clones the `Arc<Version>` under a read lock, so a
//!   reader pins one immutable snapshot for a whole lookup;
//! - `apply` is a clone-mutate-store read-modify-write of that `Arc`;
//! - every caller of `apply` holds the engine's `Mutex<VersionSet>`
//!   first, which is what makes the read-modify-write atomic;
//! - a compaction publishes its removals and its additions in **one**
//!   `apply`, so no reader can observe a version with the inputs gone
//!   and the output not yet there.
//!
//! An SSTable is stood in for by its file id and the one user key it
//! holds. Everything the handoff can get wrong happens between the level
//! a compaction reads and the level it writes, so two levels are enough.
