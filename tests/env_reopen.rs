//! Reopening a database has to read the filesystem it was written to.
//!
//! Every path `Db::open` takes must go through the configured [`Env`].
//! A single `std::fs` call that slips past it looks fine on the default
//! backend, where `Env` *is* the real filesystem, and makes reopening
//! impossible on every other one: the call looks for the database on
//! disk, does not find it, and the open fails with a bare `NotFound`
//! that names nothing.
//!
//! That is exactly what happened to WAL replay, which opened its log
//! with `std::fs::File::open` while everything around it used `Env`.
//! The default backend never noticed. `MemEnv` is the cheapest backend
//! that would, so it is what guards the rule here.
