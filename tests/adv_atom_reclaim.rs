//! Adversarial reclamation probes for the kovan-backed read view.
//!
//! Every `LiveSst` in a `Version` owns an open file descriptor, and a
//! published `ReadView` owns the `Arc<Version>`. Replacing a view now
//! retires it to kovan instead of dropping it, so these probes ask the
//! only question that matters for a storage engine: when does the
//! descriptor actually close, and does the unlinked inode's disk space
//! actually come back?
//!
//! Deterministic: every count below is a syscall-observable fact
//! (`/proc/self/fd`), never a timing loop.
//!
//! kovan reclamation is process-global: a batch is freed when every
//! reservation slot that could still reach it releases, and a thread
//! keeps its slot published after its last guard drops. So any thread
//! in the process that pinned and then idled delays this database's
//! retired views, even though the descriptor count below is scoped to
//! one temporary directory. These probes therefore run as a single
//! sequential test rather than five parallel ones: under the default
//! harness the sibling test threads are themselves idle pinners and
//! would gate what is being measured, turning a real property into a
//! reading of the harness.

// The whole file measures descriptors through `/proc/self/fd`, and its
// subject is the POSIX behaviour where an unlinked file keeps its bytes
// until the last descriptor closes. Windows has neither: there is no
// procfs to read, so every count comes back zero and the assertions
// become vacuous, and a file unlinked with a handle open stays
// delete-pending rather than becoming an unlinked-but-open inode.
