//! Fault-injection substrate for regolith's durability, crash and corruption
//! tests.
//!
//! Four facilities, each in its own submodule and all re-exported here so
//! a test only ever writes `use common::fault::...`:
//!
//! 1. [`shim`] + [`child`]: a subprocess crash harness. The workload runs
//!    in a real child process that really dies, at a kill point chosen by
//!    meaning rather than by wall clock.
//! 2. [`power`]: power-loss simulation, which is a different failure from
//!    a process crash and is the one that actually tests durability.
//! 3. [`prefix`]: the valid-prefix validator, the property these tests
//!    exist to assert.
//! 4. [`bytes`]: byte-level mutators and file locators for deliberate
//!    corruption.
//!
//! # The distinction the whole module is built around
//!
//! A `kill -9` does not model a power cut. When a process is killed, every
//! byte it wrote is still in the OS page cache and the kernel goes on to
//! write it to disk. Nothing is lost that was not lost already. A power
//! cut discards everything that was never `fsync`ed. A suite that only
//! kills the process and calls durability proven is a false green, so this
//! module provides both and keeps them clearly separate:
//!
//! * [`run_child`] kills a process. Use it for "the engine survives losing
//!   its memory".
//! * [`simulate_power_loss`] additionally throws away the unsynced bytes.
//!   Use it for "the engine survives losing its disk writes".
//!
//! # How power loss is simulated here, and why
//!
//! `strace` is not installed on this machine and there is no way to
//! install it, so option (a) of the ALICE-style approaches was
//! unavailable. Option (b) was chosen: a **pure-Rust `LD_PRELOAD`
//! interposer** over `write`, `pwrite64`, `writev`, `fsync`, `fdatasync`,
//! `open`/`openat`, `ftruncate`, `close`, `rename` and `unlink`. It
//! records the real syscall stream of the child, including the kernel
//! thread id and the exact byte offset of every write, and
//! [`power::simulate_power_loss`] replays that stream to work out which
//! byte ranges were never followed by a successful `fsync` on their file,
//! then rewrites the directory as the filesystem would have left it.
//!
//! This is the ALICE model driven by what regolith actually did, not by an
//! assumption about what regolith does. Interposition is sound here because
//! regolith performs all data I/O through `std::fs`, which calls the glibc
//! symbols; it uses `rustix` raw syscalls only for `flock` and `fadvise`,
//! which move no file data, and it has no `mmap` write path.
//!
//! The weaker option (c) exists as [`power::simulate_power_loss_modelled`]
//! for platforms where the shim cannot run. **It is not used on this
//! machine.** It encodes an assumption about regolith's sync policy into the
//! test, so it prints a warning and is documented as weaker at its
//! definition. [`shim::available`] reports which world a test is in;
//! [`shim::require`] panics rather than degrading silently.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Every kill point is either a semantic point in the workload or the nth
//! matching syscall counted by the shim, never a sleep. Every workload is
//! generated from a fixed seed ([`DEFAULT_SEED`]) by the same function in
//! the parent and the child. Every byte of injected garbage comes from a
//! seeded stream. There is no wall-clock dependency anywhere in the kill
//! path, so a fast machine and a slow one crash at the same byte.
