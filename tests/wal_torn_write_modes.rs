//! Adversarial probe for the torn-tail rule under the tear modes a power cut can leave
//! inside a WAL record.
//!
//! `Wal::replay` treats an *incomplete* trailing record as the end of
//! the log, which is the fix. A record whose bytes are all present but
//! wrong is treated as corruption and refuses the open. Truncation is
//! not the only thing a power cut leaves behind: a device that tears at
//! sector granularity, or a filesystem that allocated blocks it never
//! wrote, leaves the record's full length with garbage or zeros in it.
//! If that shape can reach the last WAL record, an ordinary crash
//! refuses the open and every earlier acknowledged write goes with it.
