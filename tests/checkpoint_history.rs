//! A checkpoint checked against the history that produced it.
//!
//! The Elle harness checks whether a *live* history is consistent. It
//! says nothing about a database derived from one, because its fault
//! injection only damages WAL tails. A checkpoint that silently dropped
//! an acknowledged write would pass every Elle model in the tree.
//!
//! The same method catches it though: record what committed and when,
//! then hold the derived database to that record. `Db::write_sequenced`
//! makes the boundary exact rather than approximate - each write reports
//! the sequence it committed at, and the captured version reports the
//! sequence it captured, so "acknowledged before the capture" is a
//! comparison rather than a guess about thread timing.
