#![cfg(loom)]

//! loom models of the read-view publication protocol.
//!
//! # What these models check, and what they do not
//!
//! `kovan` carries no `cfg(loom)` instrumentation: its pointer word is
//! `core::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize` (swappable for shuttle's, never
//! for loom's), and its epoch/slot protocol is a 128-bit DCAS loom has
//! no type for. A loom model that called the real `ReadViewCell`
//! would therefore run kovan on hardware atomics, give loom's
//! scheduler no yield point inside `Atom::load` or `Atom::rcu`, and
//! explore a handful of spawn/join orders while proving nothing.
//!
//! So these models do not call kovan. They transcribe, in loom
//! atomics, the protocol regolith builds *on top of* `Atom`: the
//! compare-exchange retry loop, the four mutation closures the engine
//! passes it, and the load ordering the read path depends on. Each
//! model names the source lines it transcribes. The transcription is
//! the boundary of what is proved: a divergence between one of these
//! models and the line it names is not caught here.
//!
//! Three things are deliberately out of scope, because loom cannot see
//! them:
//!
//! * **Reclamation.** The models never free a retired view. When a view
//!   may be freed is kovan's guard contract, checked by kovan's own
//!   shuttle suite, not here.
//! * **The DCAS epoch protocol** behind `Atom::load`'s wait-free bound.
//! * **Torn reads of a view.** A `ReadView` is one heap allocation
//!   behind one pointer, so the model publishes one word. That a whole
//!   view is published in one step is structural in both, not a
//!   property either one tests.
//!
//! What is left is genuinely regolith's, and every model below would fail
//! if regolith got it wrong. Each ships with a negative control that
//! mutates one decision and asserts loom reports the violation, so a
//! model that stopped exploring cannot pass silently. Every model also
//! asserts a floor on the number of interleavings loom explored.
