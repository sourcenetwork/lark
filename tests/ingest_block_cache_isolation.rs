//! Regression gate for a silent data-loss bug in
//! `Db::ingest_external_files`, found while reviewing the metadata
//! checksums and not one of
//! the six fixes under review.
//!
//! Every source file was pre-opened as `SsTableReader::open(path, 0)` and
//! then read through the engine's shared block cache. That cache is keyed
//! by `(file_id, block_offset)`, so all sources shared one namespace: the
//! second and every later source read the *first* source's cached blocks
//! back at the same offsets. The re-encoded table the engine wrote
//! therefore held the first file's entries, the later files' entries were
//! gone, and the call returned `Ok(())` with no error, no warning and no
//! ticker. It reproduced identically on the pre-change tree.
//!
//! Sources are now opened under distinct ids and read through a cache
//! private to the call, so neither aliasing can occur. The mechanism is
//! pinned two ways here: the loss disappeared when the block cache was
//! disabled, and it survived across separate `ingest` calls, which is
//! what a shared cache namespace predicts and a within-one-call ordering
//! bug would not. Both probes are kept as the gate.
