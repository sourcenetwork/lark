//! Independent adversarial review of the discarded-table open guard.
//!
//! The guard was relaxed so a crash inside the very first flush no longer
//! costs the WAL's acknowledged writes. A relaxation of a data-loss guard
//! is only safe if it did not also open the door it was holding shut, so
//! every probe here pushes on the *dismissal* rules rather than on the
//! refusal ones: each rule is handed a file that satisfies it and still
//! carries real data, and the question asked is whether the database then
//! opens on top of it.
//!
//! A zeroed tail is the sharp case, and it found a hole. A power cut that
//! truncates the MANIFEST is the same power cut that can leave a complete
//! table's final delayed-allocation block reading back as zeros, so "the
//! last 64 bytes are zero, therefore the flush never finished" and "a
//! real table lost its tail to the same crash" are not different files.
//! An earlier revision of the guard dismissed the first reading and so
//! opened on top of the second. The guard now dismisses an unreferenced
//! table only when it is zero bytes long or its footer parses and its
//! index block is empty, and these probes are the regression gate for
//! that line.
